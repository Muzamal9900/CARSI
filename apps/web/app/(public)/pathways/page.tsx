          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            A learning pathway is a structured sequence of courses designed to build expertise in a
            specific area of restoration or cleaning. Unlike individual courses, pathways guide you
            through prerequisite knowledge, core competencies, and advanced techniques in a logical
            progression. CARSI&apos;s pathways align with IICRC certification requirements, ensuring
            you earn the right Continuing Education Credits (CECs) in the right order to achieve
            your professional goals. Each pathway maps directly to an IICRC discipline such as Water
            Restoration (WRT), Applied Microbial Remediation (AMRT), or Carpet Cleaning (CCT), so
            every course you complete contributes meaningfully towards certification or
            recertification. Pathways also eliminate guesswork — instead of choosing from dozens of
            individual courses, you follow a curated sequence that builds knowledge progressively,
            from foundational science through to advanced field techniques and industry best
            practice.

          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">Which CARSI pathway is right for me?</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Your ideal pathway depends on your current experience level and career objectives. New
            technicians should start with the Water Restoration Fundamentals pathway, which covers
            IICRC WRT certification preparation and provides the foundation for all other
            disciplines. Experienced professionals looking to expand their service offering should
            consider a multi-discipline pathway that combines WRT, AMRT, and ASD for comprehensive
            restoration capability. If you already hold IICRC certifications and need to maintain
            them, CARSI&apos;s CEC-approved courses let you accumulate credits within a structured
            pathway rather than through ad-hoc training. Specialist contractors in carpet care,
            commercial cleaning, or aged-care facility maintenance will find dedicated pathways
            tailored to those sectors. Browse the pathways below, check the estimated hours and
            target certification for each, and choose the one that matches where you are now and
            where you want your career to go.

            How do pathways help with career progression?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Structured pathways demonstrate systematic professional development to employers,
            clients, and industry bodies. Completing a CARSI pathway shows you have mastered not
            just isolated topics, but an integrated body of knowledge validated against IICRC
            standards. Many insurance panels and government tenders in Australia now require
            evidence of ongoing professional development, and a completed pathway provides exactly
            that documentation. Pathways also make it straightforward to track your CEC accumulation
            towards certification renewal — you can see at a glance how many credits you have earned
            and how many remain. For business owners, enrolling your team in pathways ensures
            consistent training standards across all technicians, reducing callbacks and improving
            customer satisfaction. Whether you are an independent operator building credibility or a
            company training a workforce, pathways turn professional development from a compliance
            burden into a competitive advantage.
