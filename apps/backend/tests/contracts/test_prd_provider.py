Pact Provider Verification Tests - PRD API

These tests verify that the FastAPI backend (provider) fulfills
the contract defined by the Next.js frontend (consumer).

Installation:
    uv add --dev pact-python
"""

import pytest

pact = pytest.importorskip(
    "pact",

"""

Run tests:
    pytest tests/contracts/test_prd_provider.py -v

Pact Broker:
    Set PACT_BROKER_URL and PACT_BROKER_TOKEN env vars
    Or place pact files in ../../../web/pacts/

How it works:
    1. Consumer (web) generates pact file with expected interactions
    2. Provider (backend) verifies it can fulfill those interactions
    3. If provider changes break the contract, tests fail
    4. Prevents breaking changes between frontend and backend
