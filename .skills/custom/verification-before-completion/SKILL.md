# Verification Before Completion

Adapted from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — MIT. Hard gate enforced before any completion claim. Evidence required — confidence is not evidence.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIM WITHOUT FRESH EVIDENCE FROM RUNNING COMMANDS
```

"Should work", "probably passes", "seems correct" are not evidence.
Running a command and reading the full output is evidence.

## The 5-Step Gate

Before making **any** completion claim:

1. **Identify** the verification command that proves your claim
2. **Execute** the command freshly (not a cached or remembered result)
3. **Read** the complete output — not just the exit code
4. **Verify** the output actually confirms what you are claiming
5. **Only then** make the claim — with the evidence included

Skipping any step violates both the letter and spirit of this rule.

## Banned Phrases

Stop immediately if you are about to use any of these. Run verification first.

| Banned Phrase                  | Why It's Banned               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| "should work"                  | Not evidence of working       |
| "probably passes"              | Not evidence of passing       |
| "seems correct"                | Not evidence of correctness   |
| "likely fixed"                 | Not evidence of being fixed   |
| "appears to be working"        | Not evidence of working       |
| "I believe this resolves"      | Belief ≠ verification         |
| "this should pass the tests"   | Should ≠ does                 |
| "the logic looks right"        | Looking right ≠ working right |
| "Done!" (before running tests) | Premature completion claim    |
| "✅" (before running tests)    | Premature completion signal   |

## Verification Commands — NodeJS-Starter-V1

### Frontend Tests

```bash
# All frontend tests (required before claiming any frontend work done)
pnpm test --filter=web

# Specific test file
cd apps/web && npx vitest run __tests__/components/my-component.test.tsx

# With coverage
cd apps/web && npx vitest run --coverage
```

### Backend Tests

```bash
# All backend tests (required before claiming any backend work done)
cd apps/backend && uv run pytest -v

# Specific test file
cd apps/backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_specific.py -v

# With coverage report
cd apps/backend && uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Full Stack

```bash
# All tests across the monorepo — required before any PR or "done" claim
pnpm turbo run test

# Type check — 0 errors required
pnpm turbo run type-check

# Lint — clean output required
pnpm turbo run lint
```

### Git State

```bash
# Confirm all changes are staged and committed
git status

# Confirm remote is up to date
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
```

## False Claims to Avoid

| Insufficient Evidence            | What You Actually Need                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Linter passed"                  | Does NOT prove tests pass → run `pnpm turbo run test`      |
| "Code changed"                   | Does NOT prove bug fixed → run the tests that were failing |
| "I'm confident it works"         | Confidence ≠ correctness → run the command                 |
| Previous test run (old session)  | Does NOT prove current state → run tests fresh             |
| Partial test run (3 of 10 tests) | Does NOT prove all pass → run the full suite               |
| Test passed in development       | Does NOT prove CI will pass → use the same CI command      |

## Verification Ritual — Per Task Type

### New Feature

```
□ Test(s) written BEFORE implementation (tdd skill)
□ Watched test fail for the expected reason
□ Watched test pass after implementation
□ Full test suite passing: pnpm turbo run test
□ TypeScript errors: pnpm turbo run type-check (0 errors)
□ Lint clean: pnpm turbo run lint
□ Manual smoke test in browser or Postman (if UI or API)
□ No console errors or warnings
```

### Bug Fix

```
□ Regression test written before fix (tdd + systematic-debugging skills)
□ Regression test failed before fix
□ Regression test passes after fix
□ Full test suite still green: pnpm turbo run test
□ Original bug confirmed resolved via manual verification
```

### Refactoring

```
□ Tests existed BEFORE the refactor (or written first via TDD)
□ All tests pass after refactor: pnpm turbo run test
□ TypeScript: 0 errors — pnpm turbo run type-check
□ No behaviour change observed (smoke test)
```

### Before Creating a PR

```
□ pnpm turbo run test — all passing, output shown in PR description or commit
□ pnpm turbo run type-check — 0 errors, output confirmed
□ pnpm turbo run lint — clean, output confirmed
□ git status — all changes committed
□ All features described in the PR manually verified
```

## Stop Signals

Stop immediately if you catch yourself:

- About to write "Done" without running tests
- About to use a banned phrase ("should work", "probably passes")
- About to commit or push without a fresh test suite run
- Relying on a test run from a previous session
- Satisfied that "the logic looks correct" without execution evidence
- About to report success on a task without completing the relevant checklist above

---

## The Non-Negotiable Rule

> **Evidence before claims, always.**

This applies to:

- All completion statements
- All implications of success ("Fixed!", "Implemented!", "✅")
- Any positive assertion about the state of the work

**No shortcuts. Run the command. Read the output. Then claim the result.**

---

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **`tdd`** — Verification before completion depends on TDD having written the tests that verification runs. Without TDD, there is nothing meaningful to verify.
- **`systematic-debugging`** — After a bug fix, use this skill to confirm the fix actually worked before claiming done.
- **`execution-guardian`** — Provides pre-execution confidence scoring; this skill provides final post-execution evidence before any completion claim.
