# Finishing a Development Branch

Adapted from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — MIT. Structured end-of-feature workflow for the NodeJS-Starter-V1 monorepo.

## Overview

Before merging or creating a PR, every development branch must pass a structured completion protocol:

1. Verify all tests pass
2. Determine the base branch and merge strategy
3. Generate a meaningful PR description
4. Execute the chosen action
5. Clean up worktrees and stale branches

---

## Step 1: Verify Tests Pass

**MANDATORY. Never skip this step.**

```bash
# Full monorepo test suite — must be green
pnpm turbo run test

# Type check — must be 0 errors
pnpm turbo run type-check

# Lint — must be clean
pnpm turbo run lint

# Optional: coverage check
cd apps/backend && uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=40
```

If ANY check fails → stop. Fix the failures before offering merge options. Do not create a PR with failing tests.

---

## Step 2: Review Commits and Determine Base Branch

```bash
# What's on this branch vs main?
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# What files changed?
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Full diff for PR description generation
git diff main...HEAD
```

Determine base branch:

- **`main`** — standard for all feature branches (NodeJS-Starter-V1 uses trunk-based development)
- **`release/*`** — if releasing to a specific version branch

---

## Step 3: Generate PR Description

Based on the commit log and diff, generate:

```markdown
## Summary

- <bullet: what was implemented/changed>
- <bullet: why this change was made>
- <bullet: key technical decisions>

## Test Plan

- [ ] `pnpm turbo run test` — all N tests passing
- [ ] `pnpm turbo run type-check` — 0 TypeScript errors
- [ ] `pnpm turbo run lint` — clean
- [ ] <manual smoke test step if applicable>
- [ ] <specific feature test step>

## Related

<!-- Link any Linear issues, PRs, or docs -->
```

**PR title format** (Conventional Commits):

```
feat(web): add contractor availability calendar component
fix(backend): resolve JWT token expiry race condition
refactor(db): migrate contractor model to SQLAlchemy 2.0 style
docs(claude): update CLAUDE.md with new auth endpoints
```

---

## Step 4: Present Options

Present **exactly** these 4 options:

```
Branch: feature/<name>
Base: main
Tests: ✅ N passing

What would you like to do?

1. Merge to main locally (fast-forward or squash)
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep branch as-is for later
4. Discard the work (type "discard" to confirm)
```

### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Fast-forward merge (clean history)
git merge --ff-only feature/<name>

# OR squash merge (single clean commit)
git merge --squash feature/<name>
git commit -m "feat(<scope>): <description>"

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push the feature branch
git push -u origin feature/<name>

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(<scope>): <description>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <bullet points>

## Test Plan
- [ ] pnpm turbo run test — N tests passing
- [ ] pnpm turbo run type-check — 0 errors
- [ ] pnpm turbo run lint — clean

EOF
)" \
  --base main
```

The PR is labelled `review-required`. Never merge without human review.

### Option 3: Keep Branch As-Is

```bash
# Push to remote for safekeeping
git push -u origin feature/<name>

# Note the branch for future reference
echo "Preserved: feature/<name> — <reason>"
```

Worktree is kept intact.

### Option 4: Discard (Requires Typed Confirmation)

Require the user to type `discard` before proceeding:

```
⚠️  This will permanently delete all work on feature/<name>.
Type "discard" to confirm: _
```

```bash
# After confirmation
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/<name>
git push origin --delete feature/<name> 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Step 5: Clean Up Worktree

**For Options 1, 4:** Remove worktree immediately after action.
**For Option 2 (PR):** Remove worktree after PR is created (branch still exists on remote).
**For Option 3 (Keep):** Preserve worktree until explicitly cleaned up.

```bash
# Return to project root
cd "D:\Node JS Starter V1"

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove .worktrees/<feature-name>

# Prune any stale references
git worktree prune

# Verify clean state
git worktree list
git branch -vv | grep gone | awk '{print $1}'  # List orphaned local branches
```

---

## Stale Branch Cleanup

Run periodically to keep the repo clean:

```bash
# List branches merged into main
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\*\|main"

# Delete merged local branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\*\|main" | xargs git branch -d

# Prune deleted remote branches
git fetch --prune

# List remote branches
git branch -r | grep -v "HEAD\|main"
```

## NodeJS-Starter-V1 PR Checklist

Before creating a PR, verify all of the following:

```
□ pnpm turbo run test — all tests passing (show count)
□ pnpm turbo run type-check — 0 TypeScript errors
□ pnpm turbo run lint — clean output
□ git status — working tree clean, all changes committed
□ git log --oneline main..HEAD — commits make sense, no junk commits
□ PR description generated with Summary + Test Plan sections
□ Conventional Commit format in PR title
□ Linear issue linked (if applicable)
□ No TODO comments left in code (or intentional TODOs noted in PR)
```

## Merge Strategy Guide

| Scenario                                | Strategy                     | Why                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Single clean commit                     | `--ff-only`                  | Preserves linear history                 |
| Multiple messy commits                  | `--squash`                   | Clean history, single commit per feature |
| Complex feature with meaningful history | Regular merge                | Preserves context                        |
| Hotfix                                  | `--ff-only` directly to main | Fast, no PR needed                       |

NodeJS-Starter-V1 default: **squash merge** into `main` for features. This keeps `git log --oneline` readable.

## Integration with Git Worktrees Skill

This skill is the natural exit point for the `git-worktrees` skill:

```
git-worktrees skill → [feature work] → finishing-branch skill
     ↑                                           ↓
  Create worktree                     Merge/PR + cleanup worktree
```

After PR is approved and merged, return here to run Step 5 cleanup.
