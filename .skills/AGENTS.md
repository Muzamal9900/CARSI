### Identified Gaps

| Skill             | Description                                                                  | Status        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **xaem-theme-ui** | Two-pass theme generation → code UI translation (high-entropy design themes) | Not installed |

**XAEM Gap Analysis**: The existing `scientific-luxury` skill enforces design constraints but does not generate themes. An XAEM-style skill would add a two-pass pipeline: (1) generate high-entropy visual themes (colour palettes, typography, spacing, animation curves), then (2) translate those themes into implementable code (CSS variables, Tailwind config, component styles). This complements `scientific-luxury` by handling the creative generation pass before constraint enforcement.

**Note**: Use `/skill-manager analyse` to run automated gap analysis across all installed skills and detect missing capabilities.

## Skill Priority

4. **retry-strategy** - For exponential backoff, circuit breaker, and retry policies
5. **data-validation** - For input sanitisation and schema patterns
6. **input-sanitisation** - For injection prevention and security
7. **audit-trail** - For structured audit event logging and compliance
8. **structured-logging** - For observability and log patterns
9. **metrics-collector** - For metrics instrumentation and analytics data
10. **tracing-patterns** - For distributed tracing and span context propagation
11. **docker-patterns** - For multi-stage builds, layer caching, and Docker Compose
12. **ci-cd-patterns** - For GitHub Actions workflows, caching, and security scanning
13. **vector-search** - For pgvector embedding queries and similarity search
14. **health-check** - For liveness, readiness, and dependency health probes
15. **graceful-shutdown** - For signal handling, connection draining, and clean teardown
16. **cache-strategy** - For caching patterns (lru_cache, Redis, Next.js fetch cache)
17. **api-contract** - For typed frontend/backend API contracts
18. **webhook-handler** - For idempotent webhook processing with signature verification
19. **state-machine** - For finite state machines and status transitions
20. **queue-worker** - For Redis-backed background job processing
21. **cron-scheduler** - For scheduled tasks and periodic jobs
22. **csv-processor** - For CSV import, export, and streaming parse
23. **email-template** - For transactional email design and delivery
24. **changelog-generator** - For automated changelog and release notes from commits
25. **genesis-orchestrator** - For workflow and phase management
26. **dashboard-patterns** - For real-time dashboard visualisation and layout
27. **scientific-luxury** - For UI/design decisions
28. **react-best-practices** - For React-specific optimisations
29. **web-design-guidelines** - For accessibility and UX audits

## Skill Activation

Skills activate automatically based on context. You can also explicitly invoke them:

```
Apply the council-of-logic skill to this code.
Use scientific-luxury guidelines for this component.
Run genesis-orchestrator for this feature build.
```

## Integration with Claude Code

Skills are loaded on-demand. Only skill names and descriptions load at startup. Full SKILL.md content loads when the agent determines relevance.

### Installation for Claude Code

```bash
# Copy custom skills to Claude Code
cp -r .skills/custom/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy Vercel skills
cp -r .skills/vercel-labs-agent-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Creating New Skills

Follow the Vercel Skills format. Use `/skill-manager generate {name}` to automate skill creation with built-in validation.

```
.skills/custom/{skill-name}/
  SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition with frontmatter
  scripts/              # Optional: executable scripts
  references/           # Optional: supplementary documentation
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

## Skill Compatibility

These skills are compatible with:

- Claude Code (claude-code)
- Cursor
