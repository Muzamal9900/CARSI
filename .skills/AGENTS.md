### Identified Gaps

| Skill             | Description                                                                  | Status        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **xaem-theme-ui** | Two-pass theme generation → code UI translation (high-entropy design themes) | Not installed |

**XAEM Gap Analysis**: The existing `scientific-luxury` skill enforces design constraints but does not generate themes. An XAEM-style skill would add a two-pass pipeline: (1) generate high-entropy visual themes (colour palettes, typography, spacing, animation curves), then (2) translate those themes into implementable code (CSS variables, Tailwind config, component styles). This complements `scientific-luxury` by handling the creative generation pass before constraint enforcement.

**Note**: Use `/skill-manager analyse` to run automated gap analysis across all installed skills and detect missing capabilities.

## Skill Activation

Skills activate automatically based on context. You can also explicitly invoke them:

```
Apply the council-of-logic skill to this code.
Use scientific-luxury guidelines for this component.
Run genesis-orchestrator for this feature build.
```

## Integration with Claude Code

Skills are loaded on-demand. Only skill names and descriptions load at startup. Full SKILL.md content loads when the agent determines relevance.

### Installation for Claude Code

```bash
# Copy custom skills to Claude Code
cp -r .skills/custom/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy Vercel skills
cp -r .skills/vercel-labs-agent-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Creating New Skills

Follow the Vercel Skills format. Use `/skill-manager generate {name}` to automate skill creation with built-in validation.

```
.skills/custom/{skill-name}/
  SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition with frontmatter
  scripts/              # Optional: executable scripts
  references/           # Optional: supplementary documentation
```
