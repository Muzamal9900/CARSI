## 🆓 No Secrets Required

### What Works Without Secrets

The template is designed to be **self-contained**:

✅ **Local Development**
- PostgreSQL + Redis in Docker
- Ollama for local AI
- JWT authentication
- Full development workflow

✅ **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**
- All tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Linting and type checking
- Coverage reports (stored as GitHub artifacts)
- Security scanning (NPM audit, Trivy)

✅ **Quality Checks**
- ESLint + Ruff linting
- TypeScript + mypy type checking
- Vitest + pytest testing
- Playwright E2E testing

**You can clone, develop, test, and iterate completely offline and without any external service accounts.**

## 🔧 How to Add Secrets to GitHub

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/settings/secrets/actions
   ```

2. **Add Each Secret**:
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Enter the secret name (exactly as shown above)
   - Paste the secret value
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Verify Secrets**:
   - You should see all secrets listed (values are hidden)
   - Secrets are available immediately to workflows

### Method 2: GitHub CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Optional: Snyk token
gh secret set SNYK_TOKEN -b "your-snyk-token-here"

# Optional: Codecov token
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN -b "your-codecov-token-here"

# Optional: Deployment secrets
gh secret set DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN -b "your-do-token-here"
gh secret set VERCEL_TOKEN -b "your-vercel-token-here"
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Only Add What You Need**:
   - Start with zero secrets
   - Add secrets only when you need specific features
   - Remove unused secrets

2. **Never Commit Secrets**:
   - Secrets are stored in GitHub's encrypted vault
   - Never add secrets to code or configuration files
   - Use `.gitignore` for local `.env` files

3. **Rotate Tokens Regularly**:
   - Rotate tokens every 90 days
   - Immediately rotate if exposed
   - Use minimal permission scopes

4. **Use Separate Tokens**:
   - Different token for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
   - Different token for each service
   - Never share tokens across projects

5. **Monitor Usage**:
   - Review workflow logs for suspicious activity
   - Check token usage in service dashboards
   - Set up alerts for failed authentication

---

## 🧪 Testing Secrets Configuration

After adding optional secrets, test by:

1. **Trigger Workflow Manually**:
   - Go to Actions → Select workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Check if jobs complete successfully

2. **Check Workflow Logs**:
   - Verify secrets are being used (not exposed in logs)
   - Look for authentication success messages
   - Confirm no "missing secret" errors

3. **Example Test Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Trigger Security workflow (Snyk runs if token exists)
   gh workflow run security.yml

   # Trigger CI workflow
   gh workflow run ci.yml

   # Check workflow status
   gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 1
   ```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Secret not found" error

**Solution**:
- Verify secret name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check secret is added to repository (not organization)
- Ensure secret is in "Repository secrets" not "Environment secrets"

### Issue: "Invalid token" error

**Solution**:
- Verify token is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check token hasn't expired
- Ensure token has correct permissions
- Generate new token if needed

### Issue: Workflows still failing after adding secrets

**Solution**:
- Re-run workflow (secrets available immediately but may need retry)
- Check workflow logs for specific error
- Verify service is accessible from GitHub Actions
- Check if additional configuration needed in workflow file
